# Met_image_downloader
A small image downloader for the Met Museum public collection.
My friend wanted to download wallpapers from their collection, but couldnt figure out how to automate it, so i slapped this together to help him. 
I don't intend on maintaining it or expanding it, but here it is.

Make sure python3 and pillow is installed.


Generate a list of Object IDs with the sort.py script. Use the --help argument if you dont know how.

Feed the list into the download.py script. Use the --help argument if you dont know how.
